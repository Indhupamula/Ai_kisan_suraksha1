Kishan-Suraksha is a smart agriculture web application designed to help farmers, especially rice growers, detect leaf diseases and manage agricultural products and orders. The platform combines AI-powered disease detection with a simple HTML/CSS/JS frontend and a MySQL database for practical farm management.

Project Overview

Farmers can upload images of rice leaves.

The system uses a machine learning model to predict leaf diseases and provide actionable recommendations.

Users can browse, add, edit, and delete products related to farming.

Buyers can place orders, and admins can manage and track orders.

Simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend for smooth interaction.

MySQL database stores users, products, and orders.

Problem Solved: Helps farmers detect diseases early, manage products, and track orders, improving crop yield and farm management efficiency.
